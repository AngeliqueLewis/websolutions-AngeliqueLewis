# Choose Your Own Adventure Code Demo

This is a front-end code demo created for the Web Solutions position. It is a single-page interactive experience built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## üß† Project Concept

The demo presents a "Choose Your Own Adventure" narrative where users make decisions that influence the story's path. This creative concept demonstrates user interaction, front-end logic, and accessible design‚Äîall without any frameworks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure for content and accessibility
- **CSS3**: Responsive styling and visual theming
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Handles logic, interactivity, and state transitions

## ‚ôø Accessibility Considerations

Accessibility was a core part of the design process:
- Semantic HTML elements (`<button>`, `<section>`, `<h1>`, etc.)
- Logical tab order and keyboard navigation
- Sufficient color contrast
- ARIA labels where needed for screen readers
- Reduced motion preferences respected (if animations are used)
