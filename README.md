# Choose Your Own Adventure Code Demo

This is a front-end code demo created for the Web Solutions position. It is a single-page interactive experience built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🧠 Project Concept

This demo is truly my own creation of a duplicate of the ny.gov website. It includes a user friendly approach. I put myself in my family members shoes less tech savvy and made it as simple to use. I hope you enjoy this project and the creativity behind it. Want to add to it see clone instructions below. Enjoy!

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure for content and accessibility
- **CSS3**: Responsive styling and visual theming
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Handles logic, interactivity, and state transitions

## ♿ Accessibility Considerations

Accessibility was a core part of the design process:
- Semantic HTML elements (`<button>`, `<section>`, `<h1>`, etc.)
- Logical tab order and keyboard navigation
- Sufficient color contrast
- ARIA labels where needed for screen readers
- Reduced motion preferences respected (if animations are used)
